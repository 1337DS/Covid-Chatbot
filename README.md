# Covid-Chatbot
The chatbot should answer the questions of the user to topics concerning Covid-19.

The bot will display r-index and similar up-to-date statistics as well as information on how to prevent and cope with covid. A focus of the bot is on creating statistics as plots. To achieve this the text input is interpreted and reasonable x and y-axis labels are applied. The data for the plot is received through APIs from credible sources like the Robert Koch Institute.
