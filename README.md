# Covid-Chatbot
The chatbot should answer the questions of the user to topics concerning Covid-19.

The bot will display r-index and similar up-to-date statistics as well as information on how to prevent and cope with covid. A focus of the bot is on creating statistics as plots. To achieve this the text input is interpreted and reasonable x and y-axis labels are applied. The data for the plot is received through APIs from credible sources like the Robert Koch Institute.

## File structure
The current development state is in the ```rasa_chatbot_v2``` folder. The ```docker_rasa_chatbot``` was our attempt to dockerize the application. However, this was not successfull. The ```Chatbot-Widget``` folder contains the files for the frontend of the chatbot.
